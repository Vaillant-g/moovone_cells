# Intro
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The test file is cells.js, and I imported and modified it in cells/src too so it can work with a React project.

This project is a bonus part for the javascript test where I have to determine the state of cells after k steps, considering both the initial configuration of cells and k.
you can chose those inputs with the form, then click "Start Simulation" to see the state of the cells change depending on k.
